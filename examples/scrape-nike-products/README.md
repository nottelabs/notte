# Scrape Nike products

This example shows how you can scrape a website using Notte.

We will focus on scraping the Nike website, but the same approach can be used to scrape any website.

Goal:
1. Scrape the categories of products on the Nike website (i.e men's shoes, women's shoes, etc.)
2. For each category, scrape the products on the page (url, name, price, image url)

## Setup

Follow the setup instructions in the [README](../README.md).

## Run

```bash
python agent.py
```

## Output

The output will be saved in the `nike_results` directory.
