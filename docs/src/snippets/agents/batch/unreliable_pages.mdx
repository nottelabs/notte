```python
# Page sometimes has timing issues
with client.Session() as session:
    batch_agent = BatchRemoteAgent(
        session=session,
        max_steps=10,
        _client=client
    )

    # Run 3 attempts
    result = await batch_agent.run(
        task="Click the submit button that appears after 2 seconds",
        n_jobs=3,
        strategy="first_success"
    )

    # Much higher success rate than single agent
```
