## Overview

Functions allow you to deploy your automations as edge functions, allowing you to run them on the edge of your network.

<Note>
Notte Functions are edge functions that can be executed on the edge of your network.

## Function Management

<WorkflowsPython />


Additionally, you can fork a public function into your own private function.

### Key points

* You can deploy functions directly from a Python file.
* Functions can be executed with custom variables
* Each function can be triggered by an event or a schedule.
* List all functions using `notte.functions.list()`.
