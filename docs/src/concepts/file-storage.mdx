File Storage provides a cloud bucket for uploading files to use in your automations and downloading files that agents retrieve from websites.

## Quick Start

```python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

client = NotteClient()
storage = client.FileStorage()

# Upload a file before the session
storage.upload("document.pdf")

# Create session with storage attached
with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
    agent = client.Agent(session=session)

    result = agent.run(
        task="Upload document.pdf to the portal and download the receipt",
        url="https://example.com/upload"
    )

# Download files the agent retrieved
for file_name in storage.list_downloaded_files():
    storage.download(file_name=file_name, local_dir="./downloads")
```

## How It Works

File Storage has two buckets:

| Bucket | Purpose | API |
|--------|---------|-----|
| **Uploads** | Files you upload for agents to use | `storage.upload()` |
| **Downloads** | Files agents download from websites | `storage.download()` |

```
┌─────────────┐                    ┌──────────────┐
│ Local Files │ ── upload() ─────> │   Uploads    │
└─────────────┘                    └──────┬───────┘
                                          │
                                          v
                                   ┌──────────────┐
                                   │   Session    │
                                   │   / Agent    │
                                   └──────┬───────┘
                                          │
                                          v
┌─────────────┐                    ┌──────────────┐
│ Local Files │ <── download() ─── │  Downloads   │
└─────────────┘                    └──────────────┘
```

## Uploading Files

Upload files from your local machine to make them available in sessions:

```python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

client = NotteClient()
storage = client.FileStorage()

# Upload a file (uses the original filename)
storage.upload("report.pdf")

# Upload with a custom name
storage.upload("report.pdf", upload_file_name="quarterly_report.pdf")

# List uploaded files
files = storage.list_uploaded_files()
print(f"Uploaded: {files}")
```

## Downloading Files

Download files that agents retrieved from websites:

```python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

client = NotteClient()
storage = client.FileStorage()

with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
    agent = client.Agent(session=session)
    agent.run(task="Download the invoice from the account page")

# List downloaded files
downloaded = storage.list_downloaded_files()
print(f"Downloaded: {downloaded}")

# Download to local directory
for file_name in downloaded:
    storage.download(
        file_name=file_name,
        local_dir="./invoices"
    )
```

### Force Overwrite

Overwrite existing local files:

```python
storage.download(
    file_name="report.pdf",
    local_dir="./downloads",
    force=True  # Overwrite if exists
)
```

## Using with Agents

Agents can interact with files on websites when storage is attached:

```python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

client = NotteClient()
storage = client.FileStorage()

# Upload files for the agent to use
storage.upload("contract.pdf")
storage.upload("signature.png")

with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
    agent = client.Agent(session=session, max_steps=15)

    result = agent.run(
        task="""
        1. Upload contract.pdf to the document portal
        2. Add signature.png to the signature field
        3. Submit the form
        4. Download the signed confirmation
        """,
        url="https://example.com/documents"
    )

# Get the confirmation the agent downloaded
for file_name in storage.list_downloaded_files():
    storage.download(file_name=file_name, local_dir="./signed")
```

## Using with Sessions

Use file storage with scripted automation:

```python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

client = NotteClient()
storage = client.FileStorage()

# Upload file
storage.upload("data.csv")

with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
    session.execute(type="goto", url="https://example.com/import")

    # Upload using the upload_file action
    session.execute(
        type="upload_file",
        selector='input[type="file"]',
        filename="data.csv"
    )

    session.execute(type="click", selector="button.submit")

# Download any files
for file_name in storage.list_downloaded_files():
    storage.download(file_name=file_name, local_dir="./results")
```

## API Reference

### FileStorage Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `upload(file_path, upload_file_name=None)` | Upload a local file to storage |
| `download(file_name, local_dir, force=False)` | Download a file to local directory |
| `list_uploaded_files()` | List files you've uploaded |
| `list_downloaded_files()` | List files downloaded by agents |

### Parameters

**upload()**
- `file_path` - Path to the local file to upload
- `upload_file_name` - Optional custom name for the uploaded file

**download()**
- `file_name` - Name of the file in storage
- `local_dir` - Local directory to save the file
- `force` - Overwrite existing file (default: False)

## Supported File Types

File storage supports all common file types:

- **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT, CSV
- **Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP
- **Archives**: ZIP, RAR, TAR, GZ
- **Media**: MP4, MP3
- **Data**: JSON, XML

## Best Practices

### 1. Attach Storage Before Starting

Always create and attach storage before starting the session:

```python
# Correct
storage = client.FileStorage()
storage.upload("file.pdf")

with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
    # Storage is available
    pass
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Filenames

```python
from datetime import datetime

timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
storage.upload("report.pdf", upload_file_name=f"report_{timestamp}.pdf")
```

### 3. Check Downloads After Session

Always check for downloaded files after the session ends:

```python
with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
    agent.run(task="Download all invoices")

# Check what was downloaded
files = storage.list_downloaded_files()
if not files:
    print("No files were downloaded")
else:
    for f in files:
        storage.download(file_name=f, local_dir="./invoices")
```
