title: What is Notte?
---

Notte is the platform for building and deploying reliable [Web AI Agents](/concepts/agents) that can act and scrape on any site.
Notte provides everything you need to automate repetitive workflows at large scale with a single API: stealthy cloud browser sessions, proxies, secure credential management, and seamless integrations with AI tools in the ecosystem.

## Why Notte?

Traditional frameworks rely on brittle scripts that break when the UI changes, or on agents that waste compute handling predictable steps. Notte enables the combination of both approaches. Deterministic scripts handle stable workflows; agents automatically step in when failures occur. You can run deterministic scripts, fully autonomous agents, or any mix between. This creates a continuum between reliability and adaptability without manual intervention.

Because full agent tooling is included and infrastructure is managed, you can move from prototype to production without maintaining separate browsers, credentials, or cloud systems.

## Key Features

A fullstack platform for secure, scalable, and intelligent web automation:

### Web Automation

- **[Run automated agents](/concepts/agents)**. LLM-powered agents to automate any web task.
- **[Take control](/concepts/operations)**: Observe, act and scrape on websites. For scenarios requiring more precise control than autonomous agents, we offer a fully functional web browser interface for LLM agents.
- **[Host repetitive workflows](/concepts/workflows)**. Create and manage reusable hybrid workflows that combine traditional deterministic steps with LLM-powered agents for reliable and cost-effective automation.

### Browser infrastructure

- **[Create instant Browser sessions](/concepts/sessions)**. Instantly launch and manage headless browsers in the cloud. Integrate with Playwright CDP, manage cookies & files, replay sessions and bypass CAPTCHAs & Bot detection.

### Security & Identity

- **[Secure your credentials](/concepts/vaults)**. We provide a secure vault and credentials management system that allows you to safely share authentication details with AI agents.
- **[Digital Identities for your agents](/concepts/personas)**. Create and manage digital identities (names, emails, phone numbers) for your agents. Use them for automated onboarding and account creation.

<Check>**Enterprise features:** SOC-2 compliant with comprehensive audit trails - On-prem options - SSO.</Check>

<Info> **[Notte MCP Server](/integrations/mcp)** Run your own model control plane for custom LLM integrations.</Info>
