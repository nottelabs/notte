[Stagehand](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand) is an open source AI browser automation framework that lets you choose what to write in code vs. natural language. By integrating with Notte, you can run Stagehand automations on cloud-hosted browsers with built-in anti-detection, captcha solving, and residential proxies.

<Note>
  This guide is compatible with Stagehand v3. If you're using an earlier version, refer to the [Stagehand migration guide](https://docs.stagehand.dev/v3/migrations/v2).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- A Notte API key ([get one here](https://console.notte.cc))
- An LLM API key (e.g., OpenAI)
- Stagehand v3

## Adding Notte to existing Stagehand implementations

If you already have a Stagehand v3 implementation, you can switch to using Notte's cloud browsers by updating your browser configuration.

### 1. Install the SDKs

```bash
pip install notte-sdk stagehand
```

### 2. Connect Stagehand to a Notte browser

Create a Notte cloud browser session and pass its CDP URL to Stagehand:

<StagehandBasic />

That's it — Stagehand is now running on a Notte cloud browser with built-in stealth and anti-detection.

## Complete example

A production-ready script using Stagehand's `observe`, `act`, and `extract` on a Notte browser:

<StagehandComplete />

Set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
NOTTE_API_KEY=your-notte-api-key
MODEL_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

## Benefits of using Notte with Stagehand

- **Anti-detection**: Notte's [stealth mode](/features/sessions/stealth-mode) keeps your automations undetected
- **Captcha solving**: Built-in [captcha solving](/features/sessions/captcha-solving) handles CAPTCHAs automatically
- **Residential proxies**: Route traffic through [residential proxies](/features/sessions/proxies) in 195+ countries
- **Live view**: Debug automations in real-time with [live view](/features/sessions/live-view)
- **Session replay**: Record and review runs with [session recordings](/features/sessions/recordings)
- **No local browser**: Run automations without installing or maintaining browsers locally
