[Massive](https://www.joinmassive.com/) is a residential proxy provider offering ethically-sourced IPs across 195+ countries. If you have a Massive account (or are considering one), you can plug their proxies directly into your Notte sessions using the [`ExternalProxy`](/features/sessions/proxies#custom-proxies) type.

This is useful when you need residential IP rotation, geo-targeted traffic, or want to route your browser automation through a dedicated proxy provider.

## Prerequisites

- A Notte API key ([get one here](https://console.notte.cc))
- A Massive account with proxy credentials — sign up at [partners.joinmassive.com](https://partners.joinmassive.com/create-account)

## Setup

### 1. Get your Massive credentials

Log in to your [Massive dashboard](https://partners.joinmassive.com) and grab your proxy username and password. Then choose a protocol:

| Protocol | Port  | Use case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| HTTP     | 65534 | Recommended for most use cases |
| HTTPS    | 65535 | For encrypted proxy connections |
| SOCKS5   | 65533 | For advanced routing needs |

### 2. Install the Notte SDK

```bash
pip install notte-sdk
```

### 3. Connect Massive to your Notte session

Pass your Massive proxy as an `ExternalProxy` when creating a session:

<MassiveBasic />

That's it — your session traffic now routes through Massive's residential network.

## Geo and device targeting

Massive supports geographic and device-type targeting by appending parameters to your username string. You can target by country, state, city, device type, or any combination:

<MassiveGeo />

<Tip>
  See the full list of targeting parameters in the [Massive guide for Notte](https://www.joinmassive.com/guides/notte).

## Complete example

A production-ready script using Massive proxies with a Notte agent:

<MassiveComplete />

Set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
MASSIVE_USERNAME=your-massive-username
MASSIVE_PASSWORD=your-massive-password
NOTTE_API_KEY=your-notte-api-key
```
