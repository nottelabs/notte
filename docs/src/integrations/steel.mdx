Steel is a developer platform that provides cloud browser infrastructure for web agents. By integrating with Notte, you can use Steel's browser infrastructure to run reliable browser agents using Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).

## Adding Steel to existing Notte implementations

### 1. Install Notte and Steel SDK

<SteelInstall />

### 2. Initialize Notte and Steel

Import the libraries and create a cloud browser session:

<SteelInit />

### 3. Connect Notte to Steel's CDP endpoint

Use Steel's CDP URL to create a Notte session:

<SteelConnect />

## Complete example script

Here's a complete, runnable script that demonstrates the full integration:

<SteelComplete />

<Note>Steel's SDK may evolve. Refer to [Steel's documentation](https://docs.steel.dev/) for the most up-to-date API details.</Note>

## Benefits of using Steel with Notte

* **No local browser management**: Run agents without installing or maintaining browsers locally
* **Cloud infrastructure**: Leverage Steel's managed browser infrastructure
* **Scalability**: Launch multiple browser sessions in parallel for concurrent tasks
* **Session control**: Programmatic control over browser lifecycle
