Agent Fallback automatically spawns an AI agent when deterministic script execution fails, providing intelligent error recovery without manual intervention.

## Overview

When executing session actions, failures can occur due to:
- Elements not found
- Unexpected page changes
- Timing issues
- Dynamic content

Agent Fallback catches these failures and uses an agent to recover:

<AgentFallbackExample />

## How It Works

### 1. Normal Execution

Actions execute normally when they succeed:

<NormalExecution />

### 2. Automatic Recovery

When an action fails, the agent spawns:

<AutomaticRecovery />

### 3. Continuation

After agent recovery, remaining actions are skipped:

```python
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Complete checkout") as fb:
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#step1")  # ✅ Success
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#step2")  # ❌ Fails - agent spawned
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#step3")  # ⏭️ Skipped (agent already handled task)
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Fragile Selectors

Handle pages with frequently changing selectors:

```python
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Click the submit button") as fb:
    # Try specific selector first (fast and cheap)
    session.execute(type="click", selector="button#submit-btn")

    # If selector changed, agent finds the button (slower but works)
```

### 2. Dynamic Content

Handle dynamically loaded content:

```python
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Click the popup close button") as fb:
    # Try clicking without waiting
    session.execute(type="click", selector=".popup-close")

    # If popup not loaded yet, agent waits and retries
```

### 3. A/B Testing

Handle pages with multiple variations:

```python
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Click continue button") as fb:
    # Try variant A
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#continue-a")

    # If user got variant B, agent adapts
```

### 4. Graceful Degradation

Start with fast scripts, fall back to AI when needed:

```python
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Navigate to pricing") as fb:
    # Fast path - direct navigation
    session.execute(type="click", selector="nav a[href='/pricing']")

    # Slow path - agent finds the pricing link if layout changed
```

## Configuration

### Task Description

The task guides the agent when it's invoked:

```python
# Clear task description helps agent understand goal
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Add the first product to cart") as fb:
    session.execute(type="click", selector=".add-to-cart")
```

### Agent Parameters

Pass agent configuration:

```python
with client.AgentFallback(
    session,
    task="Complete signup",
    max_steps=15,  # Agent parameters
    reasoning_model="anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
    use_vision=True
) as fb:
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#signup")
```

### Vault and Persona

Provide credentials to the agent:

```python
vault = client.Vault(vault_id="vault_123")

with client.AgentFallback(
    session,
    task="Login and navigate to settings",
    vault=vault
) as fb:
    # Try logging in with deterministic actions
    session.execute(type="fill", selector="#email", value="user@example.com")
    session.execute(type="fill", selector="#password", value="password123")
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#login")

    # If login flow changed, agent uses vault credentials
```

## Fallback Properties

Access information about the fallback execution:

```python
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Complete task") as fb:
    # Execute actions
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#button")

# Check what happened
print(f"All succeeded: {fb.success}")
print(f"Agent was invoked: {fb.agent_invoked}")

if fb.agent_response:
    print(f"Agent result: {fb.agent_response}")
```

### Success

Whether the task was completed successfully:

```python
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Task") as fb:
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#button")

if fb.success:
    print("Task completed successfully!")
else:
    print("Task failed even after agent intervention")
```

### Agent Response

Details from the agent if it was invoked:

```python
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Extract data") as fb:
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#button")

if fb.agent_invoked:
    print(f"Agent answer: {fb.agent_response.answer}")
    print(f"Agent steps: {len(fb.agent_response.steps)}")
```

<Accordion title="Inspecting Individual Steps">
  Access detailed information about each execution attempt:

  ```python
  with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Task") as fb:
      session.execute(type="click", selector="#btn1")
      session.execute(type="click", selector="#btn2")  # Fails

  for step in fb.steps:
      print(f"Action: {step.action}")    # The action type and parameters
      print(f"Success: {step.success}")  # Whether this step succeeded
      if not step.success:
          print(f"Error: {step.message}")  # Error message if failed
  ```

  This is useful for debugging which specific action triggered the agent fallback.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use for Brittle Workflows

Ideal for pages that change frequently:

```python
# Good use case - page layout changes often
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Click pricing link") as fb:
    session.execute(type="click", selector="a[href='/pricing']")
```

### 2. Be Specific in Tasks

Clear tasks help the agent understand what to do:

```python
# Good - specific task
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Add the blue XL t-shirt to cart") as fb:
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#add-to-cart")

# Less clear - vague task
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Do something") as fb:
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#button")
```

### 3. Try Fast Path First

Put cheap, fast actions inside the fallback:

```python
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Navigate to dashboard") as fb:
    # Fast path - direct click
    session.execute(type="click", selector="a[href='/dashboard']")

    # Agent only invoked if fast path fails
```

### 4. Don't Use for Complex Logic

Fallback is for single-goal recovery, not complex workflows:

```python
# Bad - too complex for fallback
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Complete entire checkout process") as fb:
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#cart")
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#checkout")
    session.execute(type="fill", selector="#address", value="123 Main St")
    # ... many more steps

# Better - break into smaller fallbacks
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Click cart") as fb:
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#cart")

with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Proceed to checkout") as fb:
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#checkout")
```

### 5. Monitor Fallback Rate

Track how often agents are invoked:

```python
fallback_invoked_count = 0
total_runs = 0

for _ in range(100):
    with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Task") as fb:
        session.execute(type="click", selector="#button")

    total_runs += 1
    if fb.agent_invoked:
        fallback_invoked_count += 1

fallback_rate = fallback_invoked_count / total_runs
print(f"Agent fallback rate: {fallback_rate:.1%}")

# If rate is high, consider:
# - Updating selectors
# - Using agents directly
# - Improving page stability
```

## Limitations

### Not Supported

Agent Fallback does not support:

❌ `session.scrape()` calls
❌ `raise_on_failure=True` on actions
❌ Multiple nested fallbacks

```python
# This will raise an error
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Task") as fb:
    data = session.scrape()  # ❌ Not allowed

# This will raise an error
with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Task") as fb:
    session.execute(type="click", selector="#btn", raise_on_failure=True)  # ❌ Not allowed
```

### When Not to Use

Don't use Agent Fallback for:

- Tasks that always fail (fix the script instead)
- Complex multi-step workflows (use full agent)
- Scraping/data extraction (use session.scrape or agents)
- When you need structured output (use agent with response_format)

## Error Handling

Handle failures gracefully:

```python
try:
    with client.AgentFallback(session, task="Critical task") as fb:
        session.execute(type="click", selector="#button")

    if not fb.success:
        # Even agent couldn't complete the task
        alert_failure(f"Task failed: {fb.steps[-1].message}")

except Exception as e:
    # Unexpected error
    logging.error(f"Fallback exception: {e}")
```
