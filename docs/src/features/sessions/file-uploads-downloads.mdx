description: Handle file uploads and downloads in your browser sessions
---

Notte provides integrated file storage for handling file uploads and downloads during browser automation.

## File Storage Setup

Enable file storage when creating a session:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  # Create file storage
  storage = client.FileStorage()

  # Attach to session
  with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
      page = session.page
      page.goto("https://example.com")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Uploading Files

Upload files to use in your automation:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()
  storage = client.FileStorage()

  # Upload a file
  with open("document.pdf", "rb") as f:
      storage.upload(f, filename="document.pdf")

  # Use in session
  with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
      page = session.page
      page.goto("https://example.com/upload")

      # Upload to file input
      file_input = page.locator('input[type="file"]')
      file_input.set_input_files("document.pdf")

      page.click('button[type="submit"]')
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Downloading Files

Download files during automation:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()
  storage = client.FileStorage()

  with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
      page = session.page
      page.goto("https://example.com")

      # Click download button
      page.click('a.download-link')

      # File automatically saved to storage

  # List downloaded files
  files = storage.list_downloaded_files()
  print(f"Downloaded: {files}")

  # Download file locally
  for file in files:
      local_file = storage.download(file.name)
      local_file.save(f"downloads/{file.name}")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Complete Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient
  from pathlib import Path

  client = NotteClient()
  storage = client.FileStorage()

  # 1. Upload a file
  report_file = Path("monthly_report.xlsx")
  with open(report_file, "rb") as f:
      storage.upload(f, filename="report.xlsx")

  # 2. Use in session
  with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
      page = session.page

      # Navigate to upload page
      page.goto("https://example.com/upload")

      # Upload the file
      page.locator('input[type="file"]').set_input_files("report.xlsx")
      page.click('button.submit')

      # Wait for processing
      page.wait_for_selector('.success-message')

      # Download processed result
      page.click('a.download-result')

  # 3. Get downloaded files
  downloaded = storage.list_downloaded_files()

  for file in downloaded:
      local = storage.download(file.name)
      local.save(f"results/{file.name}")
      print(f"Saved: {file.name}")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Multiple File Uploads

Upload multiple files at once:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()
  storage = client.FileStorage()

  # Upload multiple files
  files_to_upload = ["file1.pdf", "file2.pdf", "file3.pdf"]

  for filename in files_to_upload:
      with open(filename, "rb") as f:
          storage.upload(f, filename=filename)

  # Use in session
  with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
      page = session.page
      page.goto("https://example.com/bulk-upload")

      # Upload all files
      page.locator('input[type="file"]').set_input_files(files_to_upload)
      page.click('button.upload-all')
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## File Types

File storage supports all common file types:

- **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT
- **Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP
- **Archives**: ZIP, RAR, TAR, GZ
- **Media**: MP4, MP3, AVI, MOV
- **Data**: CSV, JSON, XML

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()
  storage = client.FileStorage()

  # Upload different file types
  files = {
      "document.pdf": "application/pdf",
      "image.png": "image/png",
      "data.csv": "text/csv",
      "archive.zip": "application/zip"
  }

  for filename, content_type in files.items():
      with open(filename, "rb") as f:
          storage.upload(f, filename=filename)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## File Management

Manage uploaded and downloaded files:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()
  storage = client.FileStorage()

  # List uploaded files
  uploaded = storage.list_uploaded_files()
  print(f"Uploaded files: {[f.name for f in uploaded]}")

  # List downloaded files
  downloaded = storage.list_downloaded_files()
  print(f"Downloaded files: {[f.name for f in downloaded]}")

  # Download a specific file
  file = storage.download("result.pdf")
  file.save("local_result.pdf")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## File Actions

Use Notte's file upload/download actions:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient, actions

  client = NotteClient()
  storage = client.FileStorage()

  # Upload file
  with open("document.pdf", "rb") as f:
      storage.upload(f, filename="document.pdf")

  with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
      # Navigate to page
      session.execute(actions.Goto(url="https://example.com/upload"))

      # Upload file using action
      session.execute(actions.UploadFile(
          selector='input[type="file"]',
          filename="document.pdf"
      ))

      # Download file using action
      session.execute(actions.DownloadFile(
          selector='a.download-link'
      ))
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

### 1. Clean Up Files

Remove files after use to save storage:

```python
# After automation
downloaded = storage.list_downloaded_files()

for file in downloaded:
    local = storage.download(file.name)
    local.save(f"results/{file.name}")

# Clean up remote storage (if API supports it)
# storage.clear()
```

### 2. Validate File Types

Check file types before upload:

```python
import mimetypes

def validate_file(filename):
    mime_type, _ = mimetypes.guess_type(filename)
    allowed_types = ["application/pdf", "image/png", "image/jpeg"]

    if mime_type not in allowed_types:
        raise ValueError(f"File type {mime_type} not allowed")

validate_file("document.pdf")
```

### 3. Handle Large Files

For large files, add appropriate timeouts:

```python
with client.Session(
    storage=storage,
    timeout_minutes=20  # Longer timeout for large files
) as session:
    page = session.page
    page.set_default_timeout(60000)  # 60 second timeout

    page.goto("https://example.com/upload")
    page.locator('input[type="file"]').set_input_files("large_file.zip")
```

### 4. Organize Files

Use descriptive filenames:

```python
from datetime import datetime

timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
filename = f"report_{timestamp}.pdf"

with open("report.pdf", "rb") as f:
    storage.upload(f, filename=filename)
```

## File Download Detection

Wait for downloads to complete:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient
  import time

  client = NotteClient()
  storage = client.FileStorage()

  with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
      page = session.page
      page.goto("https://example.com")

      # Get initial file count
      initial_count = len(storage.list_downloaded_files())

      # Trigger download
      page.click('a.download-link')

      # Wait for download
      timeout = 30
      start_time = time.time()

      while time.time() - start_time < timeout:
          current_count = len(storage.list_downloaded_files())
          if current_count > initial_count:
              print("Download complete!")
              break
          time.sleep(1)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## File Storage Limitations

### What Works:
- ✅ Upload files for use in sessions
- ✅ Download files during automation
- ✅ Multiple file uploads
- ✅ All common file types
- ✅ File listing and management

### Limitations:
- ❌ Maximum file size may apply (check your plan)
- ❌ Storage retention period may be limited
- ❌ Concurrent upload/download limits

## Using with Agent

Agents can upload and download files:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()
  storage = client.FileStorage()

  # Upload reference document
  with open("reference.pdf", "rb") as f:
      storage.upload(f, filename="reference.pdf")

  with client.Session(storage=storage) as session:
      agent = client.Agent(session=session)

      result = agent.run(
          task="Upload reference.pdf to the document portal and download the confirmation receipt"
      )

      print(result.answer)

  # Get downloaded files
  files = storage.list_downloaded_files()
  for file in files:
      local = storage.download(file.name)
      local.save(f"receipts/{file.name}")
  ```
