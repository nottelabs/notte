Notte supports [Cloudflare Web Bot Auth](https://webbotauth.io) HTTP message signing for browser sessions. This allows you to identify as Notte to websites that require Cloudflare's web bot authentication, enabling access to protected content and avoiding bot detection.

## How It Works

1. **Session Creation** — Create a browser session with web bot auth enabled
2. **HTTP Message Signing** — All HTTP requests are automatically signed using Notte's registered identity
3. **Authentication** — Cloudflare validates the signatures against its verified bots registry
4. **Access Granted** — Successfully authenticated requests can access protected content without triggering bot detection

When you enable web bot auth, Notte automatically signs all HTTP requests in the browser session using our registered identity. This allows you to access protected content that requires Cloudflare's web bot authentication without any additional configuration.

## Quick Start

Enable web bot auth by setting `web_bot_auth=True` when creating a session:

## Complete Example

Combine web bot auth with other session capabilities for maximum effectiveness:

## Web Bot Auth + Agent

You can also use web bot auth with Notte agents:

## Testing

You can test your web bot auth configuration by visiting [https://webbotauth.io/test](https://webbotauth.io/test) in a browser session with web bot auth enabled. This site will show you whether your requests are being properly signed and authenticated.

## When to Use Web Bot Auth

Web bot auth is useful when:

- **Accessing Cloudflare-protected sites** that block automated traffic
- **Scraping content** from websites using Cloudflare's bot management
- **Running agents** that need to interact with protected web applications
- **Building reliable automations** that won't break due to bot detection

<Note>
  Web bot auth works by cryptographically signing HTTP requests, which is different from stealth mode or proxies. For best results, consider combining all three approaches.
</Note>

## Limitations

- Web bot auth only works with sites that support Cloudflare Web Bot Auth verification
- It identifies your requests as coming from Notte — the site must recognize Notte as a verified bot
- It does not bypass all forms of bot detection (combine with [stealth mode](/features/sessions/stealth-mode) and [proxies](/features/sessions/proxies) for comprehensive coverage)
