title: Playwright vs Notte Controls
description: Understanding the difference between direct Playwright control and Notte's AI-enabled SDK
---

When working with Notte sessions, you have two ways to interact with the browser: using Playwright directly via CDP, or using Notte's AI-enabled SDK methods. Both approaches work with the same session, and you can even mix them in your automation.

## Direct Playwright Control

When you access `session.page`, you get a Playwright-compatible page object that connects directly to the browser via Chrome DevTools Protocol:

```python
page = session.page
page.goto("https://example.com")
page.fill("input[name='email']", "user@example.com")
page.click("button[type='submit']")
```

This gives you the full Playwright API - everything you can do with Playwright works here. You control the browser directly through WebSocket connections with low latency.

## Notte SDK Methods

Notte provides high-level methods designed for AI agents and structured automation:

```python
session.execute(type="goto", url="https://example.com")
obs = session.observe(instructions="Fill the email input")
action = obs.space.first()  # AI finds the right element
session.execute(action.with_value("user@example.com"))
data = session.scrape(instructions="Extract all product names")
```

These methods use Notte's backend to execute actions, with built-in AI capabilities, observability, and error handling.

## Key Differences

| Feature | Playwright (`session.page`) | Notte SDK (`execute/observe/scrape`) |
|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **API Surface** | Full Playwright API | Streamlined action-based API |
| **Dependencies** | Requires `playwright` package | Just `notte-sdk` |
| **Element Selection** | Manual CSS/XPath selectors | AI-powered natural language + selectors |
| **Page Understanding** | Manual interpretation | AI describes page with `observe()` |
| **Data Extraction** | Manual parsing | Structured LLM-powered `scrape()` |
| **Observability** | Manual logging | Session replay, action recording, live viewer |
| **Error Handling** | Manual try/except | Automatic retries and validation |
| **Network Control** | ✅ Intercept, modify requests | ❌ Not available |
| **Latency** | Lower (WebSocket) | Higher (HTTP API) |
| **Action Coverage** | Everything | Everything via extensive action library |

## Why Use Playwright?

Choose `session.page` when you need:

- **Network control** - Intercept, block, or modify requests and responses
- **Event monitoring** - Listen to console logs, network events, page errors
- **Lowest latency** - Direct WebSocket communication for high-speed operations
- **Standard patterns** - Use familiar Playwright code and examples
- **Fine-grained control** - Access to every Playwright feature

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient
  from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      page = session.page

      # Block images for faster loading
      page.route("**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg}", lambda route: route.abort())

      # Listen to network requests
      page.on("request", lambda req: print(f"→ {req.url}"))
      page.on("response", lambda res: print(f"← {res.url} ({res.status})"))

      page.goto("https://example.com")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Why Use Notte SDK?

Choose `session.execute()`, `observe()`, and `scrape()` when you need:

- **AI-powered automation** - Let AI find elements and understand pages
- **Structured data extraction** - Extract data into Pydantic models automatically
- **Built-in observability** - Session replays, trajectory tracking, live viewer
- **Simpler API** - Smaller learning curve, no Playwright knowledge required
- **Production reliability** - Automatic retries, error handling, validation
- **Agent workflows** - Designed for AI agents with semantic action spaces

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient
  from pydantic import BaseModel

  client = NotteClient()

  class Product(BaseModel):
      name: str
      price: float

  with client.Session() as session:
      session.execute(type="goto", url="https://example.com/products")

      # AI understands the page
      obs = session.observe(instructions="Find the search box")
      action = obs.space.first()  # AI picks the right element
      session.execute(action.with_value("laptops"))

      # Structured extraction with LLM
      products = session.scrape(
          response_format=list[Product],
          instructions="Extract all products with names and prices"
      )

      # Every action is recorded
      replay = session.replay()
      replay.save("automation.mp4")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Mix Both Approaches

You can combine both methods in the same session:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      # Use Notte for high-level navigation
      session.execute(type="goto", url="https://example.com")

      # Switch to Playwright for network control
      page = session.page
      page.route("**/api/*", lambda route: route.continue_(headers={
          **route.request.headers,
          "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"
      }))

      # Back to Notte for AI-powered scraping
      data = session.scrape(instructions="Extract all article titles")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## When to Choose What

### Use Playwright if:
- You need network interception or request modification
- You're integrating existing Playwright scripts
- Performance is critical (milliseconds matter)
- You need to listen to browser events

### Use Notte SDK if:
- Building AI agents that understand web pages
- You want structured data extraction
- You need session replay and debugging features
- You prefer simpler, action-based API
- Building production systems with error handling

### Use Both if:
- You need network control AND AI features
- Complex workflows with different requirements
- You want the flexibility of both approaches
