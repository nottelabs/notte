## Overview

File Storage allows you to upload files to a session and download files that agents retrieve during their work. When you upload a file, it becomes available to all agents in that session. When agents download files from websites, you can retrieve those files later.

<Info>
File Storage is **session-scoped** - all agents within a session share the same S3 bucket. Files persist beyond the session lifecycle.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. **Upload files** → Files are stored in the session's S3 bucket
2. **Run agents** → Agents can use uploaded files and download new ones from websites
3. **Download results** → Retrieve files that agents downloaded

<Warning>
**Important**: Agents can only see **filenames** of uploaded files, not their content. Use descriptive names like `"resume_john_doe.pdf"`.
</Warning>

## Basic Usage

<FileStorageBasic />

## Upload Files

Upload files before running your agents:

<FileStorageUpload />

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive filenames (agents only see the filename)
- Large files are supported (AWS S3 limits apply)

## Download Files

After agents complete their work, download files they retrieved:

<FileStorageDownload />

The `local_dir` parameter is where you want to save the file on your computer (e.g., `"./downloads"`).

## Common Use Cases

**Document Upload**: Upload resumes, forms, or documents that agents can submit to websites

**File Download**: Agents download reports, images, or data from websites for you to retrieve

**Data Processing**: Upload data files that agents can submit to web applications

## File Management

```python
# List uploaded files (available to agents)
uploaded_files = storage.list(type="uploads")

# List downloaded files (retrieved by agents from websites)
downloaded_files = storage.list(type="downloads")
```

## File Persistence

- **Session Duration**: Files are available throughout the session and persist after it ends
- **Agent Sharing**: Multiple agents in the same session share the same storage
- **Persistence**: Files remain available for download even after the session closes

Files persist after sessions end, so you can download results anytime.
