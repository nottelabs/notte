description: Record and replay your browser sessions for debugging and analysis
---

Notte automatically records every action in your browser sessions, allowing you to replay them as video for debugging and analysis.

## How Session Recording Works

Every action executed during a session is automatically recorded. After the session ends, you can download a video replay.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      page = session.page
      page.goto("https://example.com")
      page.click("button.submit")
      page.fill("input[name='email']", "user@example.com")
      # All actions automatically recorded

  # Get replay after session ends
  replay = session.replay()
  replay.save("session_recording.mp4")
  print("Recording saved!")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## What Gets Recorded

Session recordings capture:

- ✅ **Page navigation** - All page loads and URL changes
- ✅ **User interactions** - Clicks, fills, scrolls, key presses
- ✅ **DOM changes** - Dynamic content updates
- ✅ **Visual state** - What the user would see
- ✅ **Timing** - Real-time playback speed

## Downloading Replays

Download session recordings in MP4 format:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      page = session.page

      # Your automation
      page.goto("https://example.com")
      page.click("a.link")
      page.screenshot(path="screenshot.png")

  # Download recording
  replay = session.replay()

  # Save to file
  replay.save("my_automation.mp4")

  # Or get bytes
  video_bytes = replay.bytes()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Replay Analysis

Use recordings to debug and analyze automation:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  session_id = None

  try:
      with client.Session() as session:
          session_id = session.session_id
          page = session.page

          # Automation that might fail
          page.goto("https://example.com")
          page.click("button.sometimes-missing")

  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Automation failed: {e}")

      if session_id:
          # Get recording to see what happened
          replay = client.sessions.replay(session_id)
          replay.save(f"failed_{session_id}.mp4")
          print("Replay saved for analysis")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Batch Recording

Record multiple sessions for comparison:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  test_scenarios = [
      {"name": "scenario_1", "url": "https://example.com/page1"},
      {"name": "scenario_2", "url": "https://example.com/page2"},
      {"name": "scenario_3", "url": "https://example.com/page3"}
  ]

  for scenario in test_scenarios:
      with client.Session() as session:
          page = session.page
          page.goto(scenario["url"])
          # ... test automation ...

      # Save each recording
      replay = session.replay()
      replay.save(f"recording_{scenario['name']}.mp4")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Recording with Agent Runs

Agent executions are also recorded:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      # Run an agent
      agent = client.Agent(session=session, max_steps=10)
      result = agent.run(task="Find the contact email on example.com")

      # Agent's actions are recorded

  # Get recording of agent's work
  replay = session.replay()
  replay.save("agent_run.mp4")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Recording Best Practices

### 1. Name Recordings Meaningfully

Use descriptive filenames:

```python
# Good: Descriptive names
replay.save(f"login_test_{session.session_id}_{timestamp}.mp4")

# Bad: Generic names
replay.save("recording.mp4")
```

### 2. Store Recordings Securely

Recordings may contain sensitive information:

```python
from pathlib import Path

# Create secure recordings directory
recordings_dir = Path("recordings")
recordings_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

replay.save(recordings_dir / f"{session.session_id}.mp4")
```

### 3. Clean Up Old Recordings

Remove old recordings to save space:

```python
import time
from pathlib import Path

def cleanup_old_recordings(directory, days=7):
    """Remove recordings older than specified days"""
    cutoff = time.time() - (days * 86400)

    for recording in Path(directory).glob("*.mp4"):
        if recording.stat().st_mtime < cutoff:
            recording.unlink()
            print(f"Deleted old recording: {recording}")

cleanup_old_recordings("recordings/", days=7)
```

### 4. Record Only When Needed

For production, consider recording only on failures:

```python
record_on_failure = True

try:
    with client.Session() as session:
        # Your automation
        pass
except Exception as e:
    if record_on_failure:
        replay = session.replay()
        replay.save(f"error_{session.session_id}.mp4")
    raise
```

## Replay vs Live View

| Feature | Recordings | Live View |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Timing** | After session ends | During session execution |
| **Format** | MP4 video file | Browser-based stream |
| **Use Case** | Debugging, archiving | Real-time monitoring |
| **Storage** | Requires file storage | No storage needed |
| **Sharing** | Easy to share file | Requires live access |

## Recording Limitations

### What's Recorded:
- ✅ All page interactions
- ✅ Visual state changes
- ✅ Navigation and reloads
- ✅ Dynamic content

### What's NOT Recorded:
- ❌ Audio
- ❌ Network requests (use browser DevTools)
- ❌ Console logs (use CDP or logging)
- ❌ Session before first action

## Recording Storage

Recordings are:
- Stored temporarily on Notte's servers
- Available after session ends
- Retained for 24 hours
- Downloadable as MP4

<Warning>
  Recordings are deleted after 24 hours. Download them promptly if needed for later analysis.
</Warning>

## Sharing Recordings

Share recordings with your team:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient
  import boto3

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      # Your automation
      pass

  # Download recording
  replay = session.replay()

  # Upload to S3 for team access
  s3 = boto3.client('s3')
  s3.upload_file(
      Filename="local_recording.mp4",
      Bucket="team-recordings",
      Key=f"recordings/{session.session_id}.mp4"
  )
  ```
