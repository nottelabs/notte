## Using Personas for Account Creation

Personas are a powerful tool for account creation. They can be used to create accounts on websites that require 2FA authentication (both with email and phone number).

```python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

notte = NotteClient()
persona = notte.Persona(create_vault=True)

url = "https://console.notte.cc"
# create credentials for the persona
persona.add_credentials(url=url)

with notte.Session(headless=False) as session:
	agent = notte.Agent(session=session, persona=persona)
	response = agent.run(task=f"Go to {url} and create an account. Go create an API key and return the API key.", url=url)
	print(response.answer)
```
