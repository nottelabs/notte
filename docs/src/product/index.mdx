---

The **Notte Console** at [console.notte.cc](https://console.notte.cc) provides visual tools for building, testing, and deploying browser automations without writing code.

While the SDK gives you full programmatic control, the Console offers a streamlined interface for common workflows.

## Build

Create and test automations visually in the Console.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Demonstrate Mode" icon="video" href="/product/demonstrate-mode">
    Record and share live demonstrations of your automations
  </Card>

  <Card title="Studio" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" href="/product/studio">

## Deploy

Deploy automations as APIs and share them with others.

## Console vs SDK

| Task | Console | SDK |
|------|---------|-----|
| Quick prototyping | Best | Good |
| Complex logic | Limited | Best |
| Visual debugging | Best | Good |
| CI/CD integration | Limited | Best |
| Team collaboration | Best | Good |
| No-code workflows | Best | N/A |

**Use the Console when:**
- Prototyping and testing automations
- Creating demonstrations for stakeholders
- Building simple automations without code
- Browsing and deploying marketplace functions

**Use the SDK when:**
- Building production automations
- Integrating with existing codebases
- Implementing complex business logic
- Running in CI/CD pipelines

## Getting Started

1. Sign up at [console.notte.cc](https://console.notte.cc)
2. Get your API key from Settings
3. Explore the tools above

<Note>
  All Console features use the same infrastructure as the SDK. Automations built in the Console can be exported as Python code.
