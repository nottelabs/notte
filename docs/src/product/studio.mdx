Notte Automation Studio is a visual environment for building, testing, and debugging browser automations without writing code.

## What is Automation Studio?

Automation Studio provides a no-code interface where you can:

- **Record** browser interactions as workflows
- **Test** automations visually in real-time
- **Debug** issues with step-by-step playback
- **Export** workflows to Python code
- **Share** automations with your team

## Accessing Automation Studio

Open Automation Studio from the Notte Console:

1. Go to [console.notte.cc](https://console.notte.cc)
2. Navigate to **Studio** in the sidebar
3. Click **New Workflow** to start building

## Recording Workflows

### Start Recording

1. Click **Start Recording** in Studio
2. A browser window opens
3. Perform actions (clicks, fills, navigation)
4. Actions are automatically captured
5. Click **Stop Recording** when done

### Captured Actions

Studio captures:
- ✅ Page navigation
- ✅ Button clicks
- ✅ Form fills
- ✅ Dropdown selections
- ✅ Checkbox/radio interactions
- ✅ File uploads
- ✅ Scrolling

## Building Workflows

### Add Actions Manually

Instead of recording, build workflows step-by-step:

1. Click **Add Action**
2. Choose action type (Click, Fill, Navigate, etc.)
3. Configure action parameters
4. Preview in live browser
5. Add next action

### Edit Actions

Modify recorded or manual actions:

1. Click on any action in the workflow
2. Edit selectors or values
3. Preview changes in real-time
4. Save updates

## Testing Workflows

### Run in Studio

Test your workflow directly in Studio:

1. Click **Run** to execute the workflow
2. Watch in the live viewer
3. See results for each step
4. Review any errors

### Debug Mode

Step through workflows one action at a time:

1. Enable **Debug Mode**
2. Click **Step** to run one action
3. Inspect page state between actions
4. Identify issues quickly

## Exporting Workflows

### Export to Python

Convert Studio workflows to Python code:

1. Click **Export** in Studio
2. Select **Python SDK**
3. Copy the generated code
4. Use in your application

Example exported code:

```python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient, actions

client = NotteClient()

with client.Session() as session:
    # Auto-generated from Studio
    session.execute(actions.Goto(url="https://example.com"))
    session.execute(actions.Click(selector="button.submit"))
    session.execute(actions.Fill(selector="input[name='email']", value="user@example.com"))
```

### Export as Workflow

Save workflows for later use:

1. Click **Export** → **Save Workflow**
2. Name your workflow
3. Access from **My Workflows**
4. Run via API or SDK

## Collaboration

### Share Workflows

Share workflows with your team:

1. Open workflow in Studio
2. Click **Share**
3. Set permissions (View/Edit)
4. Copy share link
5. Send to team members

### Team Library

Access shared workflows:

1. Go to **Team Workflows**
2. Browse available workflows
3. Fork to create your own version
4. Edit and customize

## Studio Features

### Live Viewer

Watch automations execute in real-time:
- See browser state during execution
- Observe element highlighting
- Monitor action success/failure
- Pause execution to inspect

### Smart Selectors

Studio generates robust selectors:
- Prioritizes stable identifiers (id, data attributes)
- Falls back to CSS/XPath when needed
- Tests selector uniqueness
- Suggests alternatives

### Data Extraction

Configure data extraction visually:
- Click elements to extract
- Preview extracted data
- Define data structure
- Export as schema

### Scheduling

Schedule workflows to run automatically:
- Set recurring schedules
- Configure notifications
- View execution history
- Monitor failures

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Names

Name workflows clearly:

```
Good: "Login to Dashboard"
Good: "Scrape Product Prices"

Bad: "Workflow 1"
Bad: "Test"
```

### 2. Add Annotations

Document your workflows:
- Add notes to complex steps
- Explain why certain actions are needed
- Include expected outcomes

### 3. Test Thoroughly

Test workflows before deploying:
- Run multiple times
- Test with different data
- Verify error handling
- Check edge cases

### 4. Version Control

Keep track of changes:
- Save versions before major edits
- Document what changed
- Roll back if needed

## Studio vs Code

| Feature | Studio | Python SDK |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **Learning Curve** | No code required | Requires Python knowledge |
| **Speed** | Fast prototyping | Flexible customization |
| **Debugging** | Visual step-through | Standard debugging tools |
| **Sharing** | Easy team sharing | Code repositories |
| **Scheduling** | Built-in scheduler | Custom scheduling |
| **Best For** | Quick automation, testing | Complex logic, production |

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Logic

Add conditions to workflows:
- If element exists, do action
- If text matches, branch workflow
- Retry on failure
- Timeout handling

### Variables

Use variables in workflows:
- Extract data to variables
- Use in subsequent steps
- Pass between actions
- Dynamic values

### Loops

Repeat actions:
- Loop over list of items
- Repeat until condition
- Process multiple pages
- Batch operations

## Integration with SDK

Use Studio workflows in Python:

```python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

client = NotteClient()

# Run Studio workflow by ID
workflow = client.workflows.get("workflow_id")
result = workflow.run()

print(result)
```

## Limitations

What Studio can do:
- ✅ Visual workflow building
- ✅ Recording interactions
- ✅ Basic data extraction
- ✅ Testing and debugging
- ✅ Team collaboration

What requires SDK:
- ❌ Complex logic (if/else, loops)
- ❌ External API calls
- ❌ Database operations
- ❌ Custom Python code
- ❌ Advanced error handling
