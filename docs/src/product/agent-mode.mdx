description: Let AI agents autonomously complete browser tasks using natural language
---

Agent Mode enables AI-powered browser automation where agents understand web pages, make decisions, and complete complex tasks using natural language instructions.

## What is Agent Mode?

Agent Mode uses large language models to:

- **Understand** web pages and their structure
- **Plan** multi-step actions to complete tasks
- **Execute** browser interactions autonomously
- **Adapt** to unexpected page changes
- **Extract** structured data intelligently

## Quick Start

Create an agent and give it a task:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      agent = client.Agent(session=session, max_steps=10)

      result = agent.run(
          task="Go to example.com and find the contact email"
      )

      print(result.answer)  # "contact@example.com"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## How Agents Work

### 1. Task Understanding

The agent analyzes your natural language task:
```python
task = "Find the cheapest laptop under $1000"
```

### 2. Page Observation

The agent observes the current page:
- Understands visible elements
- Identifies interactive components
- Reads text content
- Analyzes page structure

### 3. Action Planning

The agent plans the next action:
- Navigate to search
- Enter search query
- Click search button
- Parse results

### 4. Execution

The agent executes the planned action and repeats until task completion.

## Agent Configuration

### Max Steps

Limit the number of actions an agent can take:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      agent = client.Agent(
          session=session,
          max_steps=15  # Allow up to 15 actions
      )

      result = agent.run(task="Complete the checkout process")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Custom Instructions

Provide context or constraints:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      agent = client.Agent(session=session, max_steps=10)

      result = agent.run(
          task="Find product reviews",
          instructions="Only look at reviews from the last month"
      )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Use Cases

### 1. Data Extraction

Extract information from websites:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      agent = client.Agent(session=session)

      result = agent.run(
          task="Go to the pricing page and extract all plan names and prices"
      )

      print(result.answer)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Form Filling

Complete forms intelligently:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      agent = client.Agent(session=session)

      result = agent.run(
          task="Fill out the contact form with name: John Doe, email: john@example.com, message: I'm interested in your product"
      )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 3. Multi-Step Workflows

Complete complex multi-page tasks:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      agent = client.Agent(session=session, max_steps=20)

      result = agent.run(
          task="Search for 'wireless headphones', filter by price under $100, and compare the top 3 results"
      )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### 4. Account Creation

Automate account registration:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      agent = client.Agent(session=session)

      result = agent.run(
          task="Create an account with email test@example.com and password SecurePass123"
      )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Agent Responses

Agents return structured results:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      agent = client.Agent(session=session)

      result = agent.run(task="Find the CEO's name on the About page")

      # Access results
      print(f"Answer: {result.answer}")
      print(f"Steps taken: {result.steps}")
      print(f"Success: {result.success}")
      print(f"Error: {result.error}")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Fallback Strategies

Handle agent failures gracefully:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      agent = client.Agent(session=session, max_steps=10)

      try:
          result = agent.run(task="Find contact information")

          if result.success:
              print(f"Found: {result.answer}")
          else:
              print(f"Agent failed: {result.error}")
              # Fallback to manual scraping
              data = session.scrape()

      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Error: {e}")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Agent + Session Actions

Combine agent autonomy with manual control:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session() as session:
      # Manual navigation
      session.execute(type="goto", url="https://example.com")

      # Let agent handle complex task
      agent = client.Agent(session=session)
      result = agent.run(task="Find and click the signup button")

      # Continue manually
      session.execute(type="fill", selector="input[name='email']", value="user@example.com")
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Agent Monitoring

Watch agents work in real-time:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  from notte_sdk import NotteClient

  client = NotteClient()

  with client.Session(headless=False) as session:
      # Live viewer opens automatically
      agent = client.Agent(session=session)

      result = agent.run(task="Navigate to the blog and find recent posts")
      # Watch the agent work in real-time
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Task Descriptions

Be specific about what you want:

```python
# Good: Specific and clear
task = "Go to the pricing page and extract the price of the Pro plan"

# Bad: Vague
task = "Get pricing info"
```

### 2. Set Appropriate Max Steps

Match max_steps to task complexity:

```python
# Simple task
agent = client.Agent(session=session, max_steps=5)

# Complex multi-page task
agent = client.Agent(session=session, max_steps=25)
```

### 3. Provide Context

Give agents helpful context:

```python
result = agent.run(
    task="Find the download link",
    instructions="Look in the Downloads section, the file should be a PDF"
)
```

### 4. Handle Failures

Always check for success:

```python
result = agent.run(task="...")

if not result.success:
    print(f"Agent failed: {result.error}")
    # Implement fallback
```

### 5. Use Session Replay

Review agent actions after execution:

```python
with client.Session() as session:
    agent = client.Agent(session=session)
    result = agent.run(task="...")

# Get replay to see what the agent did
replay = session.replay()
replay.save("agent_run.mp4")
```

## Agent Mode vs Manual Actions

| Feature | Agent Mode | Manual Actions |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Task Specification** | Natural language | Explicit code |
| **Adaptability** | Handles page changes | Requires code updates |
| **Complexity** | Handles multi-step tasks | Requires explicit logic |
| **Precision** | May vary | Exact control |
| **Speed** | Slower (LLM calls) | Faster |
| **Cost** | Higher (LLM usage) | Lower |
| **Best For** | Complex exploration, dynamic sites | Known workflows, production |

## Advanced Features

### Agent Memory

Agents remember information across steps:

```python
result = agent.run(
    task="Remember the product name from the first result, then search for reviews of that product"
)
```

### Multi-Agent Workflows

Use multiple agents for different tasks:

```python
with client.Session() as session:
    # Agent 1: Find products
    search_agent = client.Agent(session=session, max_steps=10)
    products = search_agent.run(task="Find all laptop models")

    # Agent 2: Extract details
    detail_agent = client.Agent(session=session, max_steps=5)
    details = detail_agent.run(task="Get specifications for the first laptop")
```

## Limitations

What agents can do:
- ✅ Navigate websites autonomously
- ✅ Understand page structure
- ✅ Fill forms intelligently
- ✅ Extract information
- ✅ Adapt to page changes

What agents cannot do:
- ❌ Guarantee 100% success rate
- ❌ Handle CAPTCHAs (use captcha solving)
- ❌ Work on sites that block bots
- ❌ Execute faster than manual actions
- ❌ Understand images/videos deeply

## Pricing

Agent Mode usage is metered based on:
- Number of LLM calls
- Complexity of tasks
- Session duration

Check your plan for details on agent usage limits.
