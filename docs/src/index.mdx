description: The fastest way to ship browser agents to production
---

Notte is a unified platform for building and running reliable browser agents. Build, run, and deploy. The ecosystem provides stealth browser sessions, web agents, automation tools, and an integrated observability layer for monitoring and debugging.

## Why Notte?

* **Complete platform** - Sessions, Agents, Functions, and Tools in one API
* **Production-ready** - Session replays, live view, and observability built in
* **Stealth infrastructure** - Residential proxies, anti-detection, and captcha solving
* **Playwright-compatible** - Works with the tools you already know
* **AI-native** - Built for browser agents from day one

# Core Concepts

### Sessions

Browser sessions with built-in anti-detection, residential proxies, and captcha solving.

```python
session = client.Session()  # Playwright-compatible browser
```

Learn more about [Sessions](/concepts/sessions), [session replay](/features/sessions/session-replay), [proxies](/features/sessions/proxies), and [captcha solving](/features/sessions/captchas).

### Actions

Browser actions API to interact with and automate browser pages.

```python
session.execute(actions.Goto(url="https://example.com"))
session.execute(actions.Click(selector="button.submit"))
```

Learn more about [Actions](TODO), [Workflows](/concepts/workflows), and building automations.

### Agents

AI-powered agents that can browse, understand, and act on websites.

```python
agent = client.Agent(session=session)
agent.run(task="Find the cheapest flight to Paris")
```

Learn more about [Agents](/concepts/agents) and [Workflows](/concepts/workflows).

### Functions

Deploy your browser automations and agents as serverless API endpoints.

```python
function = client.functions.create(name="scrape-product", code=my_script)
# GET https://api.notte.cc/functions/scrape-product
```

Functions turn your scripts into production APIs without managing infrastructure.
