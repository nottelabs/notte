## Browser Sessions

Sessions are the heart of our ecosystem. They maintain browser states and provide a reliable foundation for executing web-based operations.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Browser Sessions">
Spinning a browser session is as simple as:
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient
client = NotteClient()

with client.Session() as session:
  page = session.page # playwright page
  page.goto("https://www.notte.cc")
```

```javascript Javascript
console.log("Coming soon!");
```
</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Residential Proxies">
Humanized browser sessions from everywhere to be able to access anything. Configure proxies and stealth options like this:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient
from notte_sdk.types import NotteProxy

client = NotteClient()
proxies = NotteProxy.from_country("fr")

with client.Session(proxies=True) as session:
    _ = session.execute(url="https://www.notte.cc/")
```

```javascript Javascript
console.log("Coming soon!");
```
</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="Autosolve Captchas">
We have built-in Captcha solvers to help you navigate the web. 

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from notte_sdk import NotteClient, actions
client = NotteClient()

a1 = actions.Goto(url="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo")
a2 = actions.CaptchaSolve(captcha_type="recaptcha")

with client.Session(
    solve_captchas=True,
    browser_type="firefox", # Required for captchas
) as session:
    session.execute(a1)
    session.execute(a2)
```

```javascript Javascript

## Mission Statement

We were tired of brittle automation tools. Notte exists to make the web actionable by machines. Backed by YC, we’re building the fastest way to run reliable web agents that can browse, scrape, and act on any website.

Our mission is to empower developers to automate human-like web interactions safely, intelligently, and at scale — turning the internet into an environment agents can truly understand and operate within.
